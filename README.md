# C-Piscine-Reloaded
C Piscine Reloaded
Overview

Welcome to my repository for the C Piscine Reloaded program, an intensive coding bootcamp designed to teach the fundamentals of C programming through hands-on projects and peer-to-peer learning. Over the course of a few weeks, I built a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, and collaboration.
Key Features

    Intensive Learning: Full-time, rigorous program typically lasting 4 weeks.
    Project-Based Learning: Completed a series of progressively challenging projects to solidify understanding.
    Peer-to-Peer Collaboration: Engaged in a collaborative environment where students support each otherâ€™s learning.

Core Concepts Covered

    Basic Syntax and Structure: Understanding variables, data types, operators, and control flow.
    Functions and Recursion: Writing reusable code with functions and solving problems using recursion.
    Pointers and Memory Management: Mastering pointers, memory allocation (malloc, free), and understanding memory leaks and buffer overflows.
    Data Structures: Introduction to arrays, strings, and basic data structures like linked lists.
    File I/O: Reading from and writing to files using file descriptors and standard I/O functions.
    Modular Programming: Structuring code into multiple files and using header files for declarations.

Sample Projects

    Day 01: Basic I/O with printf.
    Day 02: Loops and Conditionals.
    Day 03: Functions and Recursion.
    Day 04: Pointers and Arrays.

Evaluation

Projects were peer-reviewed, providing continuous feedback and fostering a collaborative learning atmosphere. This approach ensured a deeper understanding of concepts through mutual assistance and constructive critique.
My Experience

Participating in the C Piscine Reloaded was a challenging and rewarding journey. The immersive, hands-on approach allowed me to rapidly develop my programming skills and establish a robust foundation in C. The collaborative environment facilitated learning from peers and enhanced my problem-solving capabilities.
